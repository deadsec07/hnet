Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to hnet!

Guidelines
- Keep pull requests small and focused on a single change.
- Match existing style and structure. Prefer standard modules and minimal dependencies.
- Include short usage notes in the relevant README when adding or changing a tool.
- Test locally in a virtual environment. Avoid platform-specific assumptions where possible.

Development
- Create and activate a venv: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
- Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run a tool from repo root, e.g.: `python tools/network/port_scanner.py`

Ethics
- Only develop and test features against systems you own or are authorized to assess.
